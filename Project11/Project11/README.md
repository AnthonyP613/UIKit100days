# Project 1 in UIKit (Day 16 to 18)

## Day 16: Issue1: The list of picture didn't come
- trying at the first place, The list of picture file didn't come without the setting of Customer Class: View Controller in the Main.storyboard. 
- not so sure, whether malfunctioning is related to the setting which somehow was missed, "Is initial ViewController".

## Day 17: Issue2: The assistant editor couldn't find any, "No Assistant Result"
- no reason defined, but as a workaround, by clicking "new windows" button under the big plus button on the right top. 

## Day 18: [Resolved/Issue3]: The optional Int in string interpolation was not going well as expected 
- corresponding to Xcode's recommendation, type casting and giving an default value were needed. It is needed to find a better way to check this. 
> error message: String interpolation produces a debug description for an optional value; did you mean to make this explict 
option1. Add an explicit cast, like 'as Int' 
option2. Use String(describing: v)
optino3. Provide default value with nil-coalescing operator 
or forcing with ! 

## Day 18: Issue4: Array sorted, need to know more 
- array.sorted() worked, but for making this more sophisticated use, needed to know more how to do this. 

## Day 23: Issue5: Fixing "Info.plist" for allowing image share feature, "Privacy - Photo Libarary Additions Usage Description"
