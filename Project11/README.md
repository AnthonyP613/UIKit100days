# Project 1 in UIKit (Day 16 to 22)

## Day 16: Issue1: The list of picture didn't come
- trying at the first place, The list of picture file didn't come without the setting of Customer Class: View Controller in the Main.storyboard. 
- not so sure, whether malfunctioning is related to the setting which somehow was missed, "Is initial ViewController".

## Day 17: Issue2: The assistant editor couldn't find any, "No Assistant Result"
- no reason defined, but as a workaround, by clicking "new windows" button under the big plus button on the right top.
