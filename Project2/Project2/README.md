# Project 2 in UIKit (Day 19 to 21)

## Day 19: Issue1: The Auto Layout issue.
- with Clicking component > clicking right click(on mouse) is not working as expected. 
- currently, when running the application, the first button's border is vertically-long rectangle. : Due to the constraint in Storayboard 
- even thought the buttons were set as width 200/ height 100, second and third ones are changed slightly.

- Still, Using Interface Builder is the issue, can't fix the border of button fittable to the image. so now bigger gray border than picture's size itself.


> ã€€Can't understand but by changing Content inset from Default to Custom, the border was set to fit into the picture. ** Content Insets
